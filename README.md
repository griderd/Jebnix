Jebnix
======

kOS Alternative for KSP

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress, and the code is not complete. If you try running it, it probably won't work.

Compilation instructions:
At the moment, Jebnix compiles, but the only running system is the Jebnix Console Debugger. If you wish to run tests,
do so there. Keep in mind that Jebnix IS NOT feature-complete, and many language features have not been written or
are only partially complete. You can expect that many are still buggy.

Projects:
Jebnix - Includes Interpreter class, file system, graphics, and standard library for interacting with the Jebnix
environment and KSP.

JebnixConsoleDebugger - Displays an interactive Jebnix console in your OS. Useful for basic testing. Uses the terminal.

JebnixDebugger - Displays an interactive Jebnix console in your OS. Useful for basic testing. Uses WinForms. 
THIS DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NOW

JebnixRPM - A plugin for RasterPropMod to give interaction with Jebnix. THIS DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NOW
